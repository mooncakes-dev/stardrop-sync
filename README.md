# Stardrop Sync

A desktop application to sync your local Stardew Valley saves with the stardew perfection tracker.
As you play the game, the application watches for a selected save file and picks up your save everytime you save the game (aka. go to sleep).

Right now, it does not upload your save to the application because the perfection tracker is undergoing a re-write and the upload process would require new API route development.

## Future vision

- Add discord authentication
- Upload the save to the perfection tracker website
- Update user's desktop application of the update progress and any issues that may or may not have came up
